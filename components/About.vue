          We are a group of high school students from Amador Valley High School dedicated <!--
          -->to spreading the knowledge of programming to people of all ages. Founded in the <!--
          -->summer of 2013 at a local Starbucks, ACE Coding began with the goal of giving as <!--
          -->many people as possible the skills for and interest in programming as a hobby or <!--
          -->career. Since its inaugural four student class, ACE Coding has expanded to each <!--
          -->of the local middle schools and has now reached hundreds of students in our <!--
          -->community through its weekly lessons, as well as several hundred more across the <!--
          -->Bay Area through its annual ACE Code Day. In fact, several of its former students <!--
          -->have now joined the team to teach programming to others just as they were taught <!--
          -->a few years earlier.
