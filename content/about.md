We are a group of high school students dedicated to spreading the knowledge of programming to people of all ages. Founded in the summer of 2013 at a local Starbucks, ACE Coding began with the goal of giving as many people as possible the skills for and interest in programming as a hobby or career. Since its inaugural four student class, ACE Coding has expanded to each of the local middle schools and has now reached hundreds of students in our community through its weekly lessons. In fact, several of its former students have now joined the team to teach programming to others just as they were taught a few years earlier.

Every year, we host [ACE Code Day](https://codeday.acecoding.org), a day on which we lead workshops on a variety of programming topics to help students further their knowledge in specialized areas of technology, **free of charge**.
